# Project Status & Next Steps - 2025-09-10

This document outlines the current status of the project, recent fixes, and the plan for immediate next steps.

## âœ… Accomplishments

1.  **Fixed Critical Auto-Logout Bug:**
    - **File:** `/frontend/src/routes/register/funeral-home/+page.svelte`
    - **Issue:** Users were logged out immediately after registration due to a session cookie race condition.
    - **Resolution:** Replaced client-side `goto` with a full page reload (`window.location.href`) to ensure the session cookie is sent with the next request.

2.  **Cleaned Up Obsolete Routes:**
    - **Action:** Deleted the old `/funeral-director` and `/funeral-director-admin-form` directories.
    - **Impact:** Simplified the codebase and removed outdated registration flows.

3.  **Verified User Flow Links:**
    - **File:** `/frontend/src/routes/for-funeral-directors/+page.svelte`
    - **Action:** Confirmed that all registration links point to the correct, modern route (`/register/funeral-home`).

4.  **Resolved Accessibility Warnings:**
    - **File:** `/frontend/src/routes/register/funeral-director/+page.svelte`
    - **Issue:** Multiple form labels were not associated with their input controls.
    - **Resolution:** Added `for` and `id` attributes to link labels and inputs, resolving all `a11y_label_has_associated_control` warnings.

## ðŸš¨ Current Blocker

- **Issue:** Broken HTML structure in `/frontend/src/routes/register/funeral-home/+page.svelte`.
- **Symptom:** The Svelte compiler is throwing a warning: `This element is implicitly closed by the following </form>`.
- **Cause:** Previous automated edits have corrupted the file, leaving one or more `<div>` tags unclosed within the `<form>` element.

## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Restore Form HTML Structure:**
    - **File:** `/frontend/src/routes/register/funeral-home/+page.svelte`
    - **Action:** The entire corrupted `<form>` section needs to be replaced with a clean, correctly-structured version. This will resolve the compiler warning and ensure the page renders as expected.

## ðŸ”® Future Considerations (From `project_readme_prompt.md`)

Once the immediate blocker is resolved, we should address the open strategic questions:

-   **Prepopulation Fields:** Define the exact fields to prepopulate when a funeral director assists with a family registration.
-   **Approval States:** Determine if additional application statuses (e.g., `under_review`) are needed for the admin UI.
