# Phase 2: Demo Scenarios & Pre-populated Data - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Tributestream Demo System has been successfully implemented. Demo sessions now automatically create realistic event data complete with streams, condolences, and service information tailored to each scenario.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

  - 1 scheduled livestream
  - 2 condolence messages
  - Funeral home information

#### **Scenario 2: Managing Multiple Services**

  - Service scheduling across multiple days

#### **Scenario 3: Legacy Celebration**
- **Character**: Dorothy Grace Wilson (95, WWII nurse)
- **Context**: Rich life history, service already completed
- **Data**:
  - Extensive biography covering 95 years
  - Completed event service
  - 7-photo slideshow spanning decades
  - 4 heartfelt condolences
  - Veteran hospital volunteer work

#### **Scenario 4: Viewer Experience**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Seeding Functions (`seedData.ts`)

#### **`seedDemoMemorial()`**
- Creates Firestore event document with:
  - Full biographical data
  - Service date/time/location
  - Funeral home information
  - Owner assignment (demo owner user)
  - Demo session tracking
  - Privacy settings
  - Realistic view counts

#### **`seedDemoStreams()`**
- Creates event stream subcollections with:
  - Scheduled, live, or completed status
  - RTMP credentials (demo placeholders)
  - Playback URLs for completed streams
  - Viewer count statistics
  - Demo session tracking

#### **`seedDemoCondolences()`**
- Creates condolence subcollections with:
  - Realistic messages from various relationships
  - Public/private settings
  - Timestamp backdating for realism
  - Updates event condolence counter

#### **`seedDemoScenario()`**
- Orchestrates all seeding in correct order
- Returns event ID and slug for redirect
- Handles errors gracefully
- Updates session document with event info

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Session Creation API (`/api/demo/session`)

**Enhanced to:**
1. Create 4 demo users (existing Phase 1)
2. Create demo session document (existing Phase 1)
3. **NEW**: Seed realistic data based on selected scenario
4. **NEW**: Store event ID and slug in session
5. **NEW**: Return event slug in response for redirect
6. Generate custom token and return

**Benefits:**
- Single API call creates entire demo environment
- Data seeding happens transparently
- Users immediately see realistic content
- Graceful fallback if seeding fails

### Demo Landing Page (`/demo`)

**Updated to:**
- Accept event slug from session creation response
- Redirect directly to created event page
- Fallback to `/my-portal` if no event created
- Enhanced user experience with immediate content

---

## 📊 Data Characteristics

### Realistic Details

**Dates & Times:**
- Past dates use relative calculations (e.g., "3 days ago")
- Future dates for scheduled services
- Service times during typical hours (11am-4pm)

**Content Quality:**
- Professional obituary writing
- Authentic biography narratives
- Realistic condolence messages
- Appropriate relationship context

**Statistics:**
- View counts: 100-600 (realistic range)
- Stream viewers: 50-300 (appropriate for services)
- Peak viewers: 25-150 (realistic engagement)

### Demo Isolation

**All data tagged with:**
- `isDemo: true` flag
- `demoSessionId` for cleanup
- Owner UID set to demo owner user
- Separate from production data

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Integration

### Cleanup Process

The existing cleanup API (`/api/demo/cleanup`) will automatically delete:
1. ✅ Demo memorials (filtered by `demoSessionId`)
2. ✅ Streams subcollection
3. ✅ Condolences subcollection
4. ✅ User documents
5. ✅ Firebase Auth users

**Note**: Cleanup already handles cascade deletes properly via existing implementation.
