## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)

### 1.1 Update Type Definitions ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/lib/types/stream.ts`
  - Added `streamingMethod` field
  - Added `methodConfigured` field
  - Added phone-to-obs fields (`phoneSourceStreamId`, `phoneSourcePlaybackUrl`, `phoneSourceWhipUrl`)
  - Added phone-to-mux fields (`muxStreamId`, `muxStreamKey`, `muxPlaybackId`, `muxWhepUrl`, `restreamingEnabled`)
  - Added `recordingSources` for multi-source recording
  - Added `preferredRecordingSource` field
  - Updated `StreamCreateRequest` interface with `streamingMethod` parameter

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/lib/types/streaming-methods.ts`

  - Created `OBSMethodConfig` interface
  - Created `PhoneToOBSMethodConfig` interface
  - Created `PhoneToMUXMethodConfig` interface
  - Added type guards (`isOBSMethod`, `isPhoneToOBSMethod`, `isPhoneToMUXMethod`)
  - Added validation helper `isValidStreamingMethod`
  - Created `STREAMING_METHOD_INFO` for UI display data

### 1.2 Server-Side Method Setup ✅
**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/lib/server/streaming-methods.ts`
  - Implemented `setupOBSMethod()` - creates single Cloudflare RTMP stream
  - Implemented `setupPhoneToOBSMethod()` - creates two Cloudflare streams (phone + OBS)
  - Stubbed `setupPhoneToMUXMethod()` - to be implemented in Phase 5
  - Added `cleanupStreamingMethod()` stub for resource cleanup

### 1.3 Update Stream Creation API ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/routes/api/memorials/[memorialId]/streams/+server.ts`
  - Added imports for streaming method utilities
  - Added `streamingMethod` parameter to POST handler (defaults to 'obs')
  - Added streaming method validation
  - Replaced single Cloudflare setup with method-based setup logic
  - Added method-specific configuration storage
  - Store `streamingMethod` and `methodConfigured` in stream data
  - Store method-specific fields (phone source, MUX config) based on selected method

---

## ✅ Phase 2: OBS Method Implementation (COMPLETE)

### 2.1 Create Method Selection UI ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/lib/ui/stream/StreamCard.svelte`
  - Added method selection state management
  - Created method selection grid with all three options
  - Added `selectMethod()` function to configure selected method
  - Conditional rendering: show selection or method-specific UI
  - Added hover effects and disabled states for method cards
  - "Coming Soon" badge for phone-to-mux method

### 2.2 Build OBS Method Component ✅
**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/lib/ui/stream/methods/OBSMethodUI.svelte`
  - Displays method header with icon (💻) and description
  - Shows RTMP URL with copy button
  - Shows Stream Key (password field) with copy button
  - Includes setup instructions (5-step guide)
  - Live indicator with pulsing animation when stream is broadcasting
  - Matches design system (colors, spacing, typography)

### 2.3 Integration Complete ✅
- Method selection UI integrated into StreamCard
- OBS method UI replaces old StreamCredentials for OBS streams
- Backward compatibility maintained (falls back to StreamCredentials if no method)
- Stream management API already supports method updates (generic update handler)

### 2.4 User Flow ✅
1. **New Stream Created** → `methodConfigured: false` → Shows method selection UI
2. **User Selects OBS** → API call updates stream → Page reloads
3. **Configured Stream** → `streamingMethod: 'obs'` → Shows OBS credentials UI
4. **Copy RTMP/Key** → User configures OBS → Starts streaming
5. **Goes Live** → Live indicator appears with pulsing animation

## ✅ Phase 3: Phone to OBS Method (COMPLETE)

### 3.1 Create PhoneToOBSMethodUI Component ✅
**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/lib/ui/stream/methods/PhoneToOBSMethodUI.svelte`
  - Two-panel layout: OBS Setup + Phone Camera
  - OBS panel shows RTMP credentials for final output stream
  - Phone panel shows browser source URL for OBS
  - Integrated BrowserStreamer component for phone camera feed
  - Complete workflow instructions
  - Live status indicators for both phone and OBS streams
  - Responsive design (stacks vertically on mobile)

### 3.2 Dual Stream Architecture ✅
**How It Works:**
1. **Phone Source Stream** (`phoneSourceStreamId`)
   - User starts phone camera via BrowserStreamer (WebRTC/WHIP)
   - Streams to dedicated Cloudflare live input
   - Generates playback URL for OBS browser source

2. **OBS Destination Stream** (main `streamKey` / `rtmpUrl`)
   - OBS adds phone feed as Browser source
   - Mixes with other sources (overlays, graphics, etc.)
   - Streams final output via RTMP
   - Recorded by Cloudflare

### 3.3 User Flow ✅
1. **User selects "Phone to OBS"** from method selection
2. **Two panels appear:**
   - Left: OBS credentials (RTMP URL + Stream Key)
   - Right: Browser Source URL + Phone camera interface
3. **User configures OBS:**
   - Sets stream credentials from left panel
   - Adds Browser source with URL from right panel
4. **User starts phone camera:**
   - Clicks "Allow Camera & Microphone"
   - Preview appears in browser
   - Clicks "Start Streaming"
5. **Phone feed appears in OBS:**
   - Browser source shows live phone camera
   - User arranges scene with other sources
6. **User starts OBS streaming:**
   - Final mixed output streams to memorial
   - Both streams can have independent live indicators

### 3.4 Integration Complete ✅
- StreamCard updated to render PhoneToOBSMethodUI
- BrowserStreamer reused from existing components
- Callback handlers for phone stream start/end
- Status tracking for both streams
- Backward compatibility maintained

  - RTMP ingest URL helpers

### 4.2 Phone to MUX Setup Implementation ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/lib/server/streaming-methods.ts`
  - Implemented `setupPhoneToMUXMethod()` function
  - Creates Cloudflare live input for phone streaming (WHIP)
  - Creates optional MUX live stream for backup recording
  - Graceful degradation if MUX not configured
  - Dual recording architecture (Cloudflare primary + MUX backup)

### 4.3 PhoneToMUXMethodUI Component ✅
**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/lib/ui/stream/methods/PhoneToMUXMethodUI.svelte`
  - Dual recording architecture visualization
  - Primary recording badge (Cloudflare)
  - Backup recording badge (MUX - optional)

## 🔍 Key Decisions Made

1. **Default Method:** All new streams default to 'obs' method for backward compatibility
2. **Type Safety:** Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all method configurations
3. **Modular Setup:** Each method has dedicated setup function in server utilities
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Phone-to-MUX stubbed with clear error message until Phase 5
5. **Storage Strategy:** Method-specific fields stored conditionally to avoid undefined values

## ⚠️ Known Issues / TODOs

- [ ] Implement cleanup logic for deleted streams
- [ ] Add migration script for existing streams (set default method)
- [ ] Phone to MUX method implementation pending (Phase 5)
- [ ] MUX integration not yet configured
