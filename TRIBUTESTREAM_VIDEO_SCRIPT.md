**[Pause, slight smile]**

"Let's get started."

## SECTION 1: FUNERAL DIRECTOR REGISTRATION (1:00 - 3:00)

### ON CAMERA - TRANSITION

**[Gesture to side, as if introducing screen share]**

"First, let's look at the funeral director experience. If you're a funeral professional, here's how you get started with Tributestream."

### SCREEN RECORDING - Funeral Director Registration

**[Navigate to tributestream.com]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"When you visit tributestream.com, you'll see our homepage. Up in the top right, we have two main options: 'Create Memorial' for families, and 'Book Demo' for funeral directors.

**[Click 'Book Demo' or navigate to registration]**

For funeral directors, the registration process is straightforward. You'll provide:
- Your name and contact information
- Your funeral home name and location
- Your professional email
- A secure password

**[Fill out form demonstration]**

The beauty of our system is that it's designed specifically for memorial services. We understand your workflow, and we've built the platform around it.

**[Submit registration]**

Once you're registered, you immediately have access to your funeral director dashboard."

### ON CAMERA - KEY POINT

**[Back to talking head]**

"Now here's what makes this powerful for funeral directors: You're not just getting a streaming tool. You're getting a complete memorial management system."

---

## SECTION 2: FUNERAL DIRECTOR DASHBOARD & FAMILY REGISTRATION (3:00 - 5:30)

### SCREEN RECORDING - Dashboard Tour

**VOICEOVER:**
"This is your funeral director dashboard. From here, you can manage all your memorial services in one place.

**[Navigate dashboard]**

The most common workflow is registering a family. Let me show you how simple this is.

**[Click 'Register Family' or similar]**

When you're working with a family, you can quickly create their memorial account right from your dashboard. You'll enter:
- The loved one's name
- Service details and location
- The family contact's name and email
- Service date and time

**[Fill out quick family registration form]**

What happens next is important: The system automatically creates a memorial page, generates a unique link, and sends the family an email with their login credentials.

**[Submit form, show confirmation]**

The family receives an email that includes:
- Their username and temporary password
- A direct link to their memorial page
- Instructions on how to access the service calculator
- Information about scheduling and customization options

**[Show sample email if possible]**

This means you can set up a family in under two minutes, right there at the arrangement conference."

### ON CAMERA - BENEFIT HIGHLIGHT

**[Back to talking head, enthusiastic but respectful]**

"Think about what this means for your funeral home: No more back-and-forth emails. No complicated setup. You handle the arrangements, enter the details once, and the family has everything they need to manage their memorial service online."

---

## SECTION 3: FAMILY REGISTRATION & LOGIN (5:30 - 7:00)

### ON CAMERA - TRANSITION

**[Gesture, warm tone]**

"Now let's look at this from the family's perspective. What do they experience?"

### SCREEN RECORDING - Family Registration

**VOICEOVER:**
"Families can also register directly on our website if they want to create a memorial themselves.

**[Navigate to homepage, click 'Create Memorial']**

The process is simple and compassionate. They provide:
- Their name and email
- Their loved one's name
- Basic contact information
- A secure password

**[Fill out owner/family registration]**

Once registered, they're taken directly to their profile page where they can create and manage their memorial.

**[Show profile page with memorial creation]**

Creating a memorial is straightforward. They enter their loved one's name, and the system generates a beautiful, unique memorial page immediately.

**[Demonstrate memorial creation]**

Now here's where it gets really useful. Every memorial has access to our service calculator—this is where families plan and schedule their service."

---

## SECTION 4: SERVICE CALCULATOR & SCHEDULING (7:00 - 9:30)

### SCREEN RECORDING - Calculator Demonstration

**VOICEOVER:**
"The service calculator is the heart of the Tributestream system. This is where families—or funeral directors working with families—plan every detail of the service.

**[Navigate to calculator/schedule page]**

You'll see three service tiers:
- **Solo at $599** - Perfect for intimate graveside services or simple ceremonies
- **Standard at $1,299** - Our most popular option for traditional funeral services  
- **Premium at $1,699** - For elaborate services with extended coverage

**[Scroll through tier options]**

Each tier includes 2 hours of coverage, and families can add additional time at $125 per hour.

**[Select a tier, demonstrate]**

Now, here's what makes this powerful: The system lets you schedule:
- The main service location and time
- Additional locations, like a graveside service after the church
- Multiple days if needed

**[Fill out main service details]**

For example, let's say we're planning a service at St. Mary's Church at 10 AM on Saturday, with a burial service afterward at Memorial Gardens at 1 PM.

**[Add additional service]**

I'll add the main service here—location, date, time, estimated hours. Then I'll add the graveside service as an additional location.

**[Show pricing update in real-time]**

Notice how the pricing updates automatically? The system calculates everything: base package, additional hours, extra locations—all transparent, all upfront.

**[Scroll to add-ons section]**

Families can also add professional services:
- Professional photography
- Audio/visual support
- Live musician
- USB memory drives with the service recording

**[Check an add-on, show price update]**

Everything is optional, and the pricing is always clear."

### ON CAMERA - VALUE PROPOSITION

**[Back to talking head, earnest tone]**

"This is crucial: Families know exactly what they're paying for, and they can plan a service that fits their budget and their vision. No surprises, no hidden fees."

---

## SECTION 5: PAYMENT PROCESSING (9:30 - 11:00)

### ON CAMERA - TRANSITION

**[Professional, reassuring tone]**

"Once the family has planned their service, they're ready to book. Let me show you how the payment process works."

### SCREEN RECORDING - Payment Flow

**VOICEOVER:**
"At the bottom of the calculator, families have two options:

**[Show buttons: 'Save and Pay Later' and 'Continue to Payment']**

They can save their configuration and pay later—maybe they need to discuss with other family members—or they can proceed immediately to secure their booking.

**[Click 'Continue to Payment']**

When they're ready, they click 'Continue to Payment' and they're taken to our secure Stripe payment interface.

**[Show Stripe checkout page]**

This is Stripe—the same payment processor used by Amazon, Google, and thousands of businesses worldwide. It's secure, reliable, and accepts all major credit cards.

**[Fill out sample payment info - DO NOT SUBMIT]**

The family enters their payment information, and once the payment is processed, their service is confirmed.

**[Show confirmation screen]**

They immediately receive:
- A confirmation email with all service details
- Their memorial page link
- Instructions for accessing streaming credentials
- Contact information for support

**[Show memorial dashboard after payment]**

And now, in their memorial dashboard, they can access everything they need: stream management, memorial customization, and service details."

### ON CAMERA - SECURITY & RELIABILITY

**[Back to talking head, confident tone]**

"Security is critical when handling payments, especially during such a sensitive time. That's why we use enterprise-grade encryption and trusted payment processing. Families can book with confidence."

## SECTION 6: THE LIVE STREAMING EXPERIENCE (11:00 - 12:30)

### ON CAMERA - THE MAGIC MOMENT

**[Warm, emotional tone]**

"Now, let's talk about what makes Tributestream special: the actual service day."

### SCREEN RECORDING - Stream Management

**VOICEOVER:**
"When the service is scheduled, the family—or the funeral director—can access the stream management page.

**[Show stream management interface]**

Here, they see their scheduled streams. Each service location has its own stream with unique credentials.

**[Click on a stream, show details]**

For each stream, the system provides:
- RTMP credentials for professional cameras
- Browser streaming for phones and tablets
- A unique stream key for OBS or similar software

**[Show browser streaming option]**

The browser streaming is incredible. You can literally start streaming from your phone—right there in the church or at the graveside—with one click. No special equipment, no technical expertise.

**[Demonstrate clicking 'Start Browser Stream' button]**

When the stream goes live, it's automatically available on the memorial page. Family and friends anywhere in the world can watch in real-time.

**[Navigate to memorial page showing live stream]**

This is what viewers see: A beautiful, professional interface with the live stream, the loved one's name, service information, and a way to leave condolences.

**[Show viewer count, if available]**

The stream supports unlimited viewers—whether it's 5 people or 500, everyone can watch together."

### ON CAMERA - EMOTIONAL PAYOFF

**[Back to talking head, sincere and warm]**

"This is what it's all about. A grandmother in California watching her grandson's service in Florida. Military family members deployed overseas attending virtually. Friends who couldn't travel sharing in the moment.

Tributestream brings people together when it matters most."

---

## SECTION 7: POST-SERVICE & RECORDINGS (12:30 - 13:30)

### SCREEN RECORDING - Recording Management

**VOICEOVER:**
"After the service, the magic continues. Every stream is automatically recorded and made available on the memorial page.

**[Show completed stream with recording]**

Family members who couldn't watch live can view the recording at any time. And for families who purchased USB memory drives, we provide downloadable copies they can keep forever.

**[Navigate to memorial page showing recording]**

The memorial page becomes a lasting tribute—a place where family and friends can return, watch the service again, share memories, and stay connected.

**[Show condolence section if applicable]**

It's more than just a livestream. It's a permanent memorial that honors their loved one's life."

---

## CLOSING (13:30 - 14:30)
