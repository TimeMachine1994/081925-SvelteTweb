# Role System Review - September 11, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the TributeStream role-based access control (RBAC) system, comparing the documented specifications with the actual implementation. The review reveals significant progress in role infrastructure but identifies critical gaps in permissions enforcement and feature completeness.

## Role System Overview

### Defined Roles
The system implements four primary user roles:

1. **`admin`** - System administrators with full access
2. **`owner`** - Memorial owners (families who create memorials)
3. **`funeral_director`** - Funeral home staff managing memorials for families
4. **`family_member`** - Family members invited to contribute to memorials
5. **`viewer`** - General users who can view and follow public memorials

## Technical Implementation Status

### Authentication & Authorization Infrastructure

#### ‚úÖ **Working Correctly**
```typescript
// hooks.server.ts - Proper role extraction
const userRecord = await adminAuth.getUser(uid);
event.locals.user = {
    uid: userRecord.uid,
    email: userRecord.email,
    displayName: userRecord.displayName,
    role: userRecord.customClaims?.role,  // ‚úÖ Correctly extracted
    admin: userRecord.customClaims?.admin
};
```

#### ‚úÖ **Access Control System**
```typescript
// memorialAccess.ts - Comprehensive permission checking
export class MemorialAccessVerifier {
    static async checkViewAccess(memorialId: string, user: UserContext)
    static async checkEditAccess(memorialId: string, user: UserContext)
    static async checkPhotoUploadAccess(memorialId: string, user: UserContext)
    static async checkLivestreamAccess(memorialId: string, user: UserContext)
}
```

### Role-Based UI Components

#### ‚úÖ **Profile Component** (`Profile.svelte`)
- Correctly displays different interfaces based on user role
- Funeral director portal shows managed memorials
- Owner portal shows owned memorials
- Proper role-based styling and icons

#### ‚úÖ **Development Tools**
- `DevRoleSwitcher.svelte` allows easy role switching in development
- Test accounts available for all roles
- Proper Firebase emulator integration

### Database Schema Compliance

#### ‚úÖ **Users Collection**
```typescript
{
    email: string,
    displayName: string,
    role: 'admin' | 'owner' | 'funeral_director' | 'family_member' | 'viewer',
    createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

#### ‚úÖ **Memorials Collection**
```typescript
{
    ownerUid: string,           // ‚úÖ Implemented
    funeralDirectorUid?: string, // ‚úÖ Implemented
    familyMemberUids?: string[], // ‚úÖ Implemented (legacy)
    createdByUserId: string,     // ‚úÖ Implemented
    // ... other fields
}
```

#### ‚úÖ **Invitations Collection**
```typescript
{
    memorialId: string,
    inviteeEmail: string,
    roleToAssign: string,
    status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected',
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Critical Gaps & Issues

### 1. **Permission Enforcement Inconsistency**
- Some endpoints check permissions properly, others don't
- Memorial creation not restricted to owners/funeral directors
- Photo upload permissions not consistently enforced

### 2. **Missing Core Features**
- No owner dashboard for managing family contributors
- No revoke access functionality
- Livestream permissions not enforced in actual livestream endpoints

### 3. **Data Model Inconsistencies**
- Some code uses `ownerUid`, others use `createdByUserId`
- `funeralDirectorUid` vs `funeralDirectorId` inconsistency
- Missing `uploadedBy` and `removedByOwner` fields in photos

### 4. **UI/UX Gaps**
- No family member management interface for owners
- No clear indication of user permissions in UI
- Missing role-specific navigation and features

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (High Impact)

1. **Standardize Permission Checks**
   - Implement consistent permission middleware for all API endpoints
   - Use `MemorialAccessVerifier` class throughout the application
   - Add permission checks to memorial creation endpoints

2. **Complete Photo Permissions**
   - Add `uploadedBy` field to photo documents
   - Implement owner moderation capabilities
   - Restrict family member photo deletion to own photos

3. **Fix Data Model Inconsistencies**
   - Standardize on `ownerUid` vs `createdByUserId`
   - Ensure `funeralDirectorUid` is consistently used
   - Update all queries to use consistent field names

### Medium Priority (Feature Completion)

4. **Implement Contributor Management**
   - Build owner dashboard for managing family members
   - Add revoke access functionality
   - Create family member status tracking

5. **Complete Livestream Permissions**
   - Enforce permissions in actual livestream endpoints
   - Implement session locking
   - Add audit trails for livestream actions

6. **Enhance Schedule Permissions**
   - Implement family member read-only access
   - Add consistent permission validation
   - Create role-specific schedule interfaces

### Long-term (Enhancement)

7. **Advanced Role Features**
   - Implement remote producer role
   - Add onsite videographer capabilities
   - Create granular permission system

8. **Audit & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive audit logging for all role-based actions
   - Permission violation monitoring
   - Role usage analytics

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Permission verification for all role combinations
- [ ] Memorial access control edge cases
- [ ] Invitation workflow testing
- [ ] Photo upload permission validation

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] End-to-end role workflows
- [ ] Cross-role interaction testing
- [ ] Permission enforcement across API endpoints
- [ ] UI role-based feature testing

### Security Tests Needed
- [ ] Privilege escalation prevention
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Role switching security
- [ ] Data isolation between roles

## Conclusion

The TributeStream role system has a solid foundation with comprehensive infrastructure and access control mechanisms. The core authentication, role assignment, and permission checking systems are well-implemented and follow security best practices.

However, significant gaps remain in feature completeness and permission enforcement consistency. The system needs focused work on:

1. **Consistent permission enforcement** across all endpoints
2. **Complete feature implementation** for photo management and contributor invitations
3. **Data model standardization** to eliminate inconsistencies
4. **UI/UX completion** for role-specific interfaces

With these improvements, the role system will provide the comprehensive access control and user experience outlined in the original specifications.
