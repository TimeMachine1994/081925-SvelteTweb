# üé¨ Livestream Archive System Fixes

## ‚úÖ **Issues Resolved**

### **Problem**: Livestreams not rendering and being available for playback when they're over

### **Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Missing Recording Status Updates**: Archive entries were created with `recordingReady: false` but never updated when Cloudflare finished processing
2. **Wrong Playback URLs**: Using live stream URLs instead of recorded video URLs
3. **No Recording Webhook**: No mechanism to receive notifications when recordings are ready
4. **Manual Status Checking**: No way to manually check and update recording status

## üîß **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Cloudflare Recording Webhook** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `/api/webhooks/cloudflare/recording/+server.ts`

  - Webhook signature verification (optional)
  - Updates livestream session with recording URLs
  - Updates memorial archive entries with recording status

- **Improvements**:
  - Immediately checks Cloudflare for recorded video when stream ends
  - Uses proper recorded video URLs instead of live stream URLs
  - Sets `recordingReady: true` if recording is immediately available
  - Stores recording metadata (duration, size, thumbnail)

### **3. Manual Recording Status Checker** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `/api/memorials/[memorialId]/livestream/archive/check-recordings/+server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manually check and update recording status for existing archives
- **Features**:
  - Checks all archive entries for a memorial
  - Updates recording status and URLs from Cloudflare API
  - Returns summary of updates made
  - Can be called by funeral directors to sync status

### **4. Enhanced Archive Player UI** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `/lib/components/LivestreamArchivePlayer.svelte`
- **Improvements**:
  - Shows processing recordings with status indicators
  - Manual "Check for New Recordings" button
  - Better debugging information
  - Proper handling of recording vs live URLs
  - Loading states and error handling

### **5. Frontend Integration** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `/lib/components/LivestreamPlayer.svelte`
- **Updates**:
  - Passes `memorialId` to archive player for API calls
  - Enables manual recording status checking

### **6. Stream Stop Integration** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `/routes/livestream/[memorialId]/+page.svelte`
- **Updates**:
  - Properly calls livestream DELETE endpoint when stopping
  - Creates archive entries automatically
  - Updates service status to 'completed'

## üìä **Data Flow**

### **When Stream Starts**:
1. Cloudflare Live Input created with `recording: { mode: 'automatic' }`
2. Livestream session stored in Firestore
3. Memorial updated with active stream info

### **When Stream Ends**:
1. Frontend calls `/api/memorials/[id]/livestream` DELETE
2. Server checks Cloudflare for immediate recording availability
3. Archive entry created with recording status and URLs
4. Memorial updated with archive entry
5. Service status updated to 'completed'

### **Recording Processing** (Async):
1. Cloudflare processes recording (can take minutes)
2. Webhook called when recording ready: `/api/webhooks/cloudflare/recording`
3. Archive entry updated with final recording URLs
4. Users see recording become available

### **Manual Status Check**:
1. User clicks "Check for New Recordings"
2. Frontend calls `/api/memorials/[id]/livestream/archive/check-recordings`
3. Server checks all archive entries against Cloudflare API
4. Updates any newly ready recordings
5. Page refreshes to show updated status
