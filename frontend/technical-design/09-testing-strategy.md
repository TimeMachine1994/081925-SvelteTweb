# 9. Testing Strategy

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Tributestream SvelteKit application. The goal is to ensure application quality, stability, and reliability by outlining the methodologies, tools, and processes for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. This strategy leverages the Firebase Emulator Suite to create a robust local testing environment that mirrors production services.

### 2.1. Unit Testing

**Objective:** To verify that individual components, functions, and utilities work correctly in isolation.

**Tools:**
*   **Vitest:** For testing Svelte components and other frontend logic. Its Vite integration provides a fast and efficient testing experience that is well-suited for a SvelteKit environment.
*   **Jest:** For testing backend utility functions within Firebase Functions, where more complex mocking or a Node.js-specific test environment may be beneficial.

**Approach:**
*   **Component Tests:** Each Svelte component will have a corresponding test file (e.g., `Component.test.ts`) that asserts its rendering output and behavior based on different props and user interactions.
*   **Function Tests:** Utility functions (e.g., data transformers, validation logic) will be tested with a variety of inputs to validate their correctness and edge-case handling.
*   **Mocking:** External dependencies and services will be mocked to ensure tests are fast, deterministic, and isolated.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

**Objective:** To verify that different parts of the application work together as intended, with a focus on data flow between the frontend, backend services, and the database.

**Tools:**
*   **Firebase Emulator Suite:** To run local instances of Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions.
*   **Vitest/Jest:** To write and run the integration test suites.

**Approach:**
*   Tests will simulate user actions that trigger interactions between services. For example, a test might create a user account (Auth), trigger a Cloud Function that writes to Firestore, and then assert that the data was written correctly.
*   We will test the data flow between the SvelteKit frontend and the emulated Firebase backend to ensure queries, data mutations, and function calls behave as expected.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Objective:** To validate complete user flows from start to finish, simulating real-world user interactions in a browser environment.

**Tools:**
*   **Playwright:** Chosen for its robust feature set, including cross-browser testing, auto-waits, and excellent debugging capabilities.

**Approach:**
*   E2E tests will cover critical user journeys, such as:
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Creating and managing a memorial page.
    *   Completing a booking through the livestream calculator.
    *   Navigating the "My Portal" dashboard.
*   Tests will run against a full application stack connected to the Firebase Emulator Suite, ensuring a high-fidelity testing environment.

### 2.4. Firebase Emulator Suite Setup

The Firebase Emulator Suite is central to our local testing strategy. It allows us to run local versions of Firebase services, providing a safe, fast, and free environment for development and testing.

**Configuration:**
*   The emulators will be configured in the `firebase.json` file.
*   A dedicated set of scripts in `package.json` will be created to start the emulators and run the different test suites (e.g., `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`).
*   The application will be configured to automatically connect to the emulators when running in a development or test environment.

## 3. Key Question

**How can we leverage Firebase Emulators to thoroughly test authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions locally?**

The Firebase Emulator Suite provides a powerful solution for comprehensive local testing of our core backend services:

1.  **Authentication:** We can test the entire authentication lifecycle by interacting with the Auth Emulator. This includes creating users, signing in, handling different authentication states (logged in/out), and testing security rules that depend on user UID or custom claims. Test suites can programmatically create and delete users for each test case, ensuring a clean state.

2.  **Firestore:** The Firestore Emulator allows us to test all database interactions locally. We can write tests that create, read, update, and delete data, and then assert the state of the database. Crucially, we can test our Firestore security rules by making requests with different authentication states to ensure that data access is properly restricted.

3.  **Cloud Functions:** We can test all our Cloud Functions (HTTP, callable, and background-triggered) locally. For callable functions, we can invoke them directly from our integration tests and assert their responses. For background-triggered functions (e.g., `onMemorialCreated`), we can perform an action on an emulated service (like writing to the Firestore Emulator) and verify that the function was triggered and executed its logic correctly. This allows us to test complex workflows that span multiple services without any real-world side effects.
