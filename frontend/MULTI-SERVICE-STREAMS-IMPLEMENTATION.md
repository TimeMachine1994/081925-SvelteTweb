## ðŸŽ¯ **Feature Overview**

Successfully implemented separate streams for each scheduled service with individual visibility controls, allowing funeral directors to manage multiple streams per memorial and control which ones appear on the memorial page.

---

## âœ… **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. Livestream Control Center Enhancements**
**File**: `/routes/livestream/[memorialId]/+page.svelte`

#### **Individual Visibility Toggles**:
- âœ… Added "Memorial Page Visibility" toggle for each service card
- âœ… Eye/EyeOff icons showing current visibility state
- âœ… Green (visible) / Gray (hidden) color coding
- âœ… Click to toggle visibility without selecting the service
- âœ… Real-time UI updates when visibility changes

#### **Visual Indicators**:
```svelte
<button onclick={(e) => toggleServiceVisibility(e, service)}>
  {#if service.isVisible !== false}
    <Eye class="w-4 h-4" />
    <span>Visible</span>
  {:else}
    <EyeOff class="w-4 h-4" />
    <span>Hidden</span>
  {/if}
</button>
```

### **2. API Endpoint Updates**
**File**: `/api/memorials/[memorialId]/scheduled-services/[serviceId]/+server.ts`

#### **Visibility Management**:
- âœ… Added `isVisible` field support to PUT endpoint
- âœ… Updates `customStreams.{serviceId}.isVisible` in Firestore
- âœ… Proper validation and error handling
- âœ… Maintains existing status and sessionId functionality

### **3. Memorial Page Multi-Stream Display**
**File**: `/lib/components/LivestreamPlayer.svelte`

#### **Separate Stream Sections**:
- âœ… **Live Services Section**: Shows currently streaming services
- âœ… **Recorded Services Section**: Shows completed services with recordings
- âœ… Each service gets its own player and header
- âœ… Only visible services (`isVisible !== false`) are displayed

#### **Service Information Display**:
- âœ… Service title with live/recorded indicator
- âœ… Date, time, location, and duration details
- âœ… Viewer count for live streams
- âœ… Recording status for completed services

#### **Player Integration**:
- âœ… Cloudflare Stream iframe players for each service
- âœ… Proper fallback handling for missing streams
- âœ… Recording vs live URL prioritization
- âœ… Responsive aspect-video containers

### **4. Data Flow Updates**
**File**: `/routes/[fullSlug]/+page.server.ts`

#### **Scheduled Services Loading**:
- âœ… Loads scheduled services using `convertMemorialToScheduledServices`
- âœ… Filters to only show visible services for public viewers
- âœ… Passes services data to LivestreamPlayer component
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience**

### **For Funeral Directors (Control Center)**:
1. **Service Management**: Each service card shows visibility toggle
2. **Clear Indicators**: Green "Visible" or Gray "Hidden" buttons
3. **Instant Feedback**: UI updates immediately when toggled

3. **Service Details**: Each stream shows date, time, location, duration
4. **Clean Layout**: Professional cards with proper spacing
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Visibility Control Logic**:
```javascript
// Default: visible (isVisible !== false)
// Hidden: explicitly set to false
// Toggle: false â†” true
const newVisibility = service.isVisible === false ? true : false;
```

### **Service Filtering**:
```javascript
// Live services (visible only)
let liveServices = $derived(
  scheduledServices.filter(s => 
    s.status === 'live' && s.isVisible !== false
  )
);

// Completed services (visible only)
let completedServices = $derived(
  scheduledServices.filter(s => 
    s.status === 'completed' && s.isVisible !== false
  )
);
```

### **Player URL Priority**:
```javascript
// For recordings: recordingPlaybackUrl > cloudflareId
// For live: cloudflareId with live iframe URL
// Fallback: processing/loading states
```

## ðŸ“Š **Data Structure**

### **Service Object**:
```javascript
{
  id: "main_main" | "custom_123",
  title: "Memorial Service",
  status: "live" | "completed" | "scheduled",
  isVisible: true | false,
  cloudflareId: "abc123",
  recordingPlaybackUrl: "https://...",
  time: { date: "2024-01-15", time: "10:00" },
  location: { name: "Chapel", address: "123 St" },
  hours: 2,
  viewerCount: 15
}
```

### **Memorial Page Data**:
```javascript
{
  memorial: Memorial,
  scheduledServices: VisibleService[], // Pre-filtered
  user: User,
  isOwner: boolean,
  isFollowing: boolean
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Usage Workflow**

### **Creating Multiple Streams**:
1. Go to Livestream Control Center
2. Click "Create New Stream" for additional services
3. Configure service details (title, time, location)
4. Each service gets its own stream credentials

### **Managing Visibility**:
1. In Control Center, see all services with visibility toggles
2. Click Eye/EyeOff button to toggle memorial page visibility
3. Changes apply immediately to public memorial page
4. Hidden services still appear in control center for management

### **Public Viewing**:
1. Memorial page shows separate sections for live and recorded services
2. Each visible service displays as its own player
3. Services appear chronologically
4. Clear status indicators (live vs recorded)
