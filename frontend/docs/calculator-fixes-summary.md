# Calculator Page Fixes Summary

## Date: August 31, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Tribute Link Display Issue
**Problem:** The custom URL created by users wasn't displaying in the booking summary component.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `BookingSummary.svelte` to use the `form.website` field for tribute link display
- Updated the component to properly show the user-entered website/obituary link

### 2. Memorial Auto-Selection Bug
**Problem:** Clicking on a package was triggering a popup error "Demo: Finalizing booking null for memorial undefined" due to incorrect data access patterns.

**Root Causes:**
- Code was trying to access `data.memorials.id` instead of `data.memorials[0].id`
- Memorial array was being treated as an object
- Syntax error on line 1 with stray 'as' before script tag

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Fixed Array Access Pattern
```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
if (data.memorials?.id) {
    await onMemorialSelect(data.memorials.id);
}

// After (correct):
if (data.memorials[0]?.id) {
    await onMemorialSelect(data.memorials[0].id);
}
```

#### B. Removed Inefficient Navigation Pattern
- Eliminated `goto` and `invalidateAll` calls after booking creation
- Now directly updating reactive `bookingId` state for better performance

#### C. Added Comprehensive Error Handling
The memorial selection logic now includes:
- Validation of booking ID existence
- Validation of memorials data structure
- Proper handling of empty memorial arrays
- Try-catch blocks for auto-selection
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback to modal display when auto-selection fails

### 3. Improved Memorial Assignment Logic

**New Flow:**
1. **No Booking ID:** Log error and return early
2. **Invalid Memorial Data:** Show assignment modal
3. **No Memorials:** Show assignment modal for user to create one
4. **Single Memorial:** 
   - Validate memorial has an ID
   - Attempt auto-selection with error handling
   - Fall back to modal if auto-selection fails
5. **Multiple Memorials:** Show modal for user selection
