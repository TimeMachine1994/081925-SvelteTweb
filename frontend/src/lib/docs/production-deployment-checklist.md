### Deployment Process

#### Step 1: Pre-Production Validation
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test

# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Security audit
npm audit --audit-level moderate
```

#### Step 2: Staging Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
- [ ] Verify all role-based workflows
- [ ] Performance testing on staging
- [ ] Security scan on staging environment

#### Step 3: Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod

# Verify deployment health
curl -f https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Monitor error rates for first hour
# Check performance metrics
# Verify all critical paths working
```

#### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
