# Role Implementation Plan Progress

**Last Updated:** September 7, 2025  
**Status:** Stage 1 & 2 Complete - All Core Features Implemented

This document consolidates the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation progress by analyzing three planning documents against the current codebase implementation.

## 📋 Planning Documents Reviewed

1. **090725-RolePlan.md** - Core role permissions and implementation steps
2. **role-feature-plan.md** - Phased feature implementation plan
3. **090725-auto-login-plan.md** - Auto-login and redirect functionality

## 🎯 User Roles Overview

The system supports four primary user roles:

| Role | Status | Portal Component | Description |
|------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| `owner` | ✅ **Implemented** | `OwnerPortal.svelte` | Memorial creators with full management rights |
| `family_member` | ✅ **Implemented** | `FamilyMemberPortal.svelte` | Invitation-based access for family contributors |
| `viewer` | ✅ **Implemented** | `ViewerPortal.svelte` | Follow/unfollow system for memorial supporters |

### 3. Memorial Access Control
**Issue**: No invitation-based access verification
- **Expected**: Family members access memorials via invitation acceptance
- **Current**: Invitation creation works, but no acceptance/verification flow
- **Impact**: Family members cannot actually access invited memorials

### 4. Funeral Director Integration
**Issue**: Funeral director role severely underdeveloped
- **Expected**: Full professional workflow with memorial creation and livestream management
- **Current**: Placeholder portal component only
- **Impact**: Core user type cannot perform intended functions

### 5. Schedule Auto-Save Missing
**Issue**: No auto-save functionality for schedule edits
- **Expected**: Auto-save every ≤5 seconds across all roles
- **Current**: Manual save only through modal interface
- **Impact**: Poor UX and potential data loss

## 📊 Implementation Priority Matrix

### 🔥 Critical (Immediate Action Required)
1. **Create `/my-portal` routing system** - Users cannot access portals
2. **Implement invitation acceptance flow** - Family members cannot join memorials
3. **Add photo permission enforcement** - Security vulnerability
4. **Build funeral director portal functionality** - Core user type non-functional

### ⚡ High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Implement follow/unfollow system** - Core viewer functionality
2. **Add schedule auto-save** - UX improvement
3. **Create family member memorial access** - Role functionality gap
4. **Build livestream permission system** - Owner/funeral director controls with start/stop functionality

### 📋 Medium Priority (Future Sprints)
1. **Enhanced invitation management** - Current system is functional but basic
2. **Admin role preview system** - Development/testing tool
3. **Audit trails and logging** - Compliance and debugging
4. **Remote producer/videographer roles** - Phase 2 features

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Week 1: Critical Infrastructure
1. Create `/my-portal` route with role-based rendering
2. Implement invitation acceptance workflow
3. Add photo upload permission enforcement
4. Build basic funeral director portal functionality

### Week 2: Core Features
1. Implement follow/unfollow system for viewers
2. Add schedule auto-save functionality
3. Create family member memorial access verification
4. Build livestream permission system

### Week 3: Polish & Testing
1. Enhanced invitation management UI
2. Comprehensive role-based testing
3. Security audit of all role permissions
4. Performance optimization

## 📈 Success Metrics

- [ ] All four user roles can access appropriate portals
- [ ] Family members can accept invitations and access memorials
- [ ] Photo uploads respect role-based permissions
- [ ] Funeral directors can create and manage memorials
- [ ] Viewers can follow/unfollow memorials
- [ ] Schedule changes auto-save across all roles

## 🔍 Technical Debt Notes

1. **Theme Integration**: Many components still use placeholder CSS classes instead of the tribute-theme.css system
2. **Type Safety**: Some API endpoints lack proper TypeScript integration
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across role-based features
4. **Testing Coverage**: No automated tests for role-based functionality
5. **Documentation**: API endpoints need comprehensive documentation
