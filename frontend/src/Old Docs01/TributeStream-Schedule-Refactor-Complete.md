# TributeStream Schedule System Refactor - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully refactored and unified the TributeStream memorial service scheduling and pricing calculator system. The system now uses Firestore as the single source of truth, implements real Stripe payment processing, and includes comprehensive email notifications.

## Key Accomplishments

### Phase 1: Data Structure Unification ✅
- **Updated Type Definitions**: Enhanced `CalculatorFormData` and `LivestreamConfig` interfaces with memorial context
- **Firestore Integration**: Unified data storage under `memorials` collection with `calculatorConfig` structure
- **Auto-Save Enhancement**: Improved `useAutoSave` composable for seamless Firestore integration

### Phase 2: Memorial-Specific Routes ✅
- **Route Structure**: Created `/schedule/[memorialId]` for memorial-specific scheduling
- **New Memorial Creation**: Added `/schedule/new` route for creating new memorials
- **Legacy Route Cleanup**: Refactored `/schedule` to redirect to appropriate memorial routes
- **Data Persistence**: Removed localStorage dependency, replaced with Firestore auto-save

### Phase 3: Real Payment Processing ✅
- **Stripe Integration**: Implemented real payment intent creation with proper authentication
- **Webhook Handling**: Complete Stripe webhook processing for payment success, failure, and action required
- **Firestore Updates**: Payment status tracking in memorial documents with history

### Phase 4: Email Service Implementation ✅
- **Resend Integration**: Professional email service with HTML templates
- **Email Types**: Confirmation, payment failure, and action required notifications
- **Template Design**: Responsive HTML email templates with TributeStream branding

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Auto-Save (Firestore) → Payment Intent → Stripe Processing → Webhook → Email Notification
```

## Dependencies Added
- `stripe@18.5.0` - Stripe payment processing
- `resend@3.x` - Email service integration

## Security Features
- **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require user authentication
- **Permission Checks**: Memorial access based on user roles (admin, owner, funeral director, family member)
- **Webhook Verification**: Stripe webhook signature validation
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on all endpoints

## User Flow

### New Memorial Creation
1. User visits `/schedule/new`
2. Enters loved one's name
3. System creates memorial in Firestore
4. Redirects to `/schedule/[memorialId]`

### Schedule Configuration
1. User configures service details on memorial-specific page
2. Auto-save triggers on form changes (2-second debounce)
3. Data saved to Firestore under `memorials/[id]/calculatorConfig`
4. User can save and return later or proceed to payment

### Payment Processing
1. User clicks "Pay Now" - creates Stripe payment intent
2. Payment intent saved to memorial's `paymentHistory`
3. User completes payment on Stripe-hosted page
4. Webhook updates memorial status and sends confirmation email

### Email Notifications
- **Success**: Confirmation email with payment details and next steps
- **Failure**: Failure notification with retry instructions
- **Action Required**: Additional verification needed notification

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Memorial Creation**
   - [ ] Visit `/schedule/new`
   - [ ] Create new memorial
   - [ ] Verify redirect to memorial-specific page

2. **Auto-Save Functionality**
   - [ ] Modify form fields
   - [ ] Verify auto-save status indicator
   - [ ] Refresh page and confirm data persistence

3. **Payment Flow**
   - [ ] Configure schedule and proceed to payment
   - [ ] Test with Stripe test cards
   - [ ] Verify webhook processing
   - [ ] Check email notifications

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Test payment failures
   - [ ] Verify error email notifications
   - [ ] Test network connectivity issues

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Set production environment variables
   export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   export RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
   export FROM_EMAIL=noreply@tributestream.com
   ```

2. **Stripe Webhook Setup**
   - Configure webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Enable events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.requires_action`
   - Copy webhook secret to environment variables

3. **Email Domain Verification**
   - Verify sending domain in Resend dashboard
   - Configure DNS records for email authentication

4. **Firestore Security Rules**
   - Ensure proper security rules for memorial access
   - Test permission enforcement

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Auto-save success rate
- Payment completion rate
- Email delivery rate
- Webhook processing latency

### Log Monitoring
- Payment intent creation logs
- Webhook processing logs
- Email sending logs
- Auto-save error logs

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing same memorial
2. **Payment Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed payments
3. **Email Templates**: More sophisticated email template system
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Payment and booking analytics
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Auto-save not working**: Check authentication and memorial permissions
2. **Payment failures**: Verify Stripe configuration and webhook setup
3. **Email not sending**: Check Resend API key and domain verification
4. **Permission errors**: Verify user role and memorial access rights

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Stripe webhook logs
stripe logs tail --filter-account=acct_...

# Test email sending
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/send-confirmation-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"memorialId":"test","paymentIntentId":"pi_test","customerEmail":"test@example.com","lovedOneName":"Test","amount":100}'
```
