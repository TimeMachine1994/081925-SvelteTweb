# Tributestream Funeral Director Registration System - Next Steps
**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Status:** Requirements Analysis & Planning

## Current System Analysis

### Existing `/register/funeral-director` Route
- **Purpose:** Family memorial registration form used during 1-on-1 sessions
- **User:** Funeral director fills this out WITH the family present
- **Data Collected:** Memorial details, family contact info, service information
- **Current State:** Functional but requires manual input each time

## Required New System: Funeral Director Onboarding

### 1. **New Funeral Director Registration Page**
**Route:** `/register/funeral-home` or `/funeral-director/apply`

**Purpose:** Allow new funeral directors to register their funeral home in the Tributestream system

**Data Collection:**
- **Funeral Home Information:**
  - Company/Funeral Home Name
  - Business License Number
  - Physical Address
  - Phone Number
  - Website (optional)
  - Years in Business

- **Primary Contact Information:**
  - Director Name
  - Title/Position
  - Email Address
  - Direct Phone Number
  - Professional License Number

- **Business Verification Documents:**
  - Business License Upload
  - Funeral Director License Upload
  - Insurance Certificate Upload
  - Professional References (optional)

- **Service Area:**
  - Geographic coverage area
  - Types of services offered
  - Pricing tier preference

**Status:** Pending admin approval after submission

### 2. **Admin Approval Workflow**
**Integration:** Existing `/admin` dashboard

**Admin Actions:**
- Review funeral director applications
- Verify uploaded documents
- Approve or reject applications with reasons
- Send notification emails to applicants

**Approval Results:**
- **Approved:** Funeral director gains access to prepopulated forms
- **Rejected:** Email with rejection reason and reapplication process

### 3. **Enhanced Family Registration Experience**

#### **For Approved Funeral Directors:**
**Route:** `/register/funeral-director` (existing, but enhanced)

**Prepopulation Logic:**
- Detect logged-in funeral director
- Auto-fill funeral home details:
  - Funeral home name
  - Director name and contact info
  - Business address
  - Standard service options

**Editable Fields:**
- All prepopulated fields remain editable
- Allows different directors from same funeral home
- Supports custom service modifications
- Family-specific memorial details

#### **Auto-Save Functionality:**
**Technology:** Browser cookies + localStorage

**Implementation:**
- Save form data every 30 seconds
- Store in encrypted cookies for session persistence
- Restore data when returning to form
- Clear saved data after successful submission

**Data Persistence:**
- Survives browser refresh
- Survives browser close/reopen
- Expires after 7 days or successful submission
- Includes timestamp for data freshness
