# Problem Breakdown: My Portal Redirection Issue

## 1. Original Issue: Unwanted Redirection from My Portal

**Description:** Users with the 'owner' role are being redirected from the `/my-portal` page to the `/app/calculator` page, even when they have existing memorials. This prevents them from accessing their portal dashboard to manage their memorials.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The redirection is enforced by a strict validation logic within `frontend/src/routes/my-portal/+page.server.ts`. Specifically, lines 139-159 contain a conditional block that checks if *all* of an owner's memorials lack "complete schedule data."

The condition for "complete schedule data" is defined as:
`!memorial.livestreamConfig || !memorial.livestreamConfig.bookingItems || memorial.livestreamConfig.bookingItems.length === 0`

This means if a memorial either:
*   Does not have a `livestreamConfig` object.
*   Has a `livestreamConfig` but no `bookingItems` property.
*   Has `livestreamConfig` and `bookingItems`, but the `bookingItems` array is empty.

If *all* memorials associated with the owner satisfy this condition, the user is redirected to the calculator page. This logic is overly restrictive, as an owner should be able to access their portal to manage other aspects of their memorials (e.g., tribute pages, photos) even if no livestream service has been fully configured.

**Relevant Log Message:**
`➡️ All owner memorials lack complete schedule data. Redirecting to calculator page.`

## 2. Introduced Bug: TypeScript Errors in `+page.server.ts`

**Description:** During attempts to resolve the redirection issue, a new bug was introduced in `frontend/src/routes/my-portal/+page.server.ts`, leading to TypeScript errors.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The error occurred on line 86, where the code was intended to retrieve a single `livestreamConfig` document from a Firestore query:

Original (Correct) Line:
`const configDoc = configSnapshot.docs[0];`

Modified (Incorrect) Line:
`const configDoc = configSnapshot.docs;`

By removing `[0]`, the `configDoc` variable was assigned an array of `QueryDocumentSnapshot` objects instead of a single `QueryDocumentSnapshot`. Subsequent lines (e.g., 87 and 89) then attempted to access properties like `.data()` and `.id` directly on this array, which are properties of a single document, not an array.

**Relevant Error Messages:**
*   `Property 'data' does not exist on type 'QueryDocumentSnapshot<DocumentData, DocumentData>[]'.`
*   `Property 'id' does not exist on type 'QueryDocumentSnapshot<DocumentData, DocumentData>[]'.`

## Proposed Solution Plan:

1.  **Fix Introduced Bug:** Correct line 86 in `frontend/src/routes/my-portal/+page.server.ts` to `const configDoc = configSnapshot.docs[0];` to resolve the TypeScript errors.
2.  **Disable Redirection Logic:** After fixing the bug, comment out the entire redirection block (lines 139-159) in `frontend/src/routes/my-portal/+page.server.ts` to allow owners to access their portal regardless of livestream schedule completion.

This plan addresses both the original problem and the bug introduced during the troubleshooting process.
