# Role Implementation Plan Progress

**Last Updated:** September 7, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress - Foundation Complete, Features Pending

This document consolidates the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation progress by analyzing three planning documents against the current codebase implementation.

## 📋 Planning Documents Reviewed

1. **090725-RolePlan.md** - Core role permissions and implementation steps
2. **role-feature-plan.md** - Phased feature implementation plan
3. **090725-auto-login-plan.md** - Auto-login and redirect functionality

## 🎯 User Roles Overview

The system supports four primary user roles:

| Role | Status | Portal Component | Description |
|------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| `owner` | ✅ **Implemented** | `OwnerPortal.svelte` | Memorial creators with full management rights |
| `family_member` | 🔄 **Partial** | `FamilyMemberPortal.svelte` | Limited access for family contributors |
| `viewer` | 🔄 **Partial** | `ViewerPortal.svelte` | Read-only access for memorial followers |
| `funeral_director` | 🔲 **Minimal** | `FuneralDirectorPortal.svelte` | Professional memorial management |

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Core Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
- **Data Model & FireCMS**: User type and role fields implemented
- **Role-Setting Endpoint**: `/api/set-role-claim` functional (admin-only)
- **Server Auth Hook**: `hooks.server.ts` includes role and admin claims
- **Role-Based UI**: Portal components exist for all roles
- **Auto-Login System**: Complete implementation with custom token flow

### Auto-Login Implementation (✅ Complete)
Based on `090725-auto-login-plan.md`, the auto-login system is **fully implemented**:

- ✅ **Registration Logic**: `register/loved-one/+page.server.ts` creates custom tokens
- ✅ **Session Handler**: `/auth/session/+page.svelte` handles client-side authentication
- ✅ **Session Creation**: `/api/session/+server.ts` creates session cookies and redirects
- ✅ **Workflow**: Complete token → session → redirect flow operational

### Owner Portal (✅ Fully Functional)
The `OwnerPortal.svelte` is **comprehensively implemented** with:

- ✅ Modern UI with role-specific theming (amber/orange with crown icon)
- ✅ Memorial management dashboard
- ✅ Payment status integration
- ✅ Action buttons for all core functions
- ✅ Legacy invitation system (functional)
- ✅ Livestream schedule management
- ✅ Multi-memorial selector

### Basic Invitation System (✅ Functional)
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: `/api/memorials/[memorialId]/invite` implemented
- ✅ **Data Types**: `invitation.ts` type definitions complete
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Owner portal includes invitation functionality
- ✅ **Firestore Rules**: Basic invitation collection support

## 🔄 Partially Implemented

### Family Member Portal (🔄 Basic Structure)
**Current State**: Minimal implementation in `FamilyMemberPortal.svelte`
- ✅ Basic component structure exists
- ✅ Memorial listing capability
- ✅ "Add Photos" action link
- 🔲 **Missing**: Full memorial access control
- 🔲 **Missing**: Photo upload permissions enforcement
- 🔲 **Missing**: Read-only schedule access

### Viewer Portal (🔄 Placeholder)
**Current State**: Component exists but minimal functionality
- ✅ `ViewerPortal.svelte` component created
- 🔲 **Missing**: Follow/unfollow functionality
- 🔲 **Missing**: Followed memorials display
- 🔲 **Missing**: Heart/like feature integration

## 🚨 Critical Gaps & Discrepancies

### 1. Portal Routing Missing
**Issue**: No `/my-portal` route exists in the codebase
- **Expected**: Role-based portal routing system
- **Current**: Portal components exist but no routing implementation
- **Impact**: Users cannot access role-specific dashboards

### 2. Photo Permission System
**Issue**: Photo upload permissions not enforced
- **Expected**: Role-based photo CRUD operations
- **Current**: Basic photo uploader exists but no role restrictions
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability - unauthorized photo access

### 3. Memorial Access Control
**Issue**: No invitation-based access verification
- **Expected**: Family members access memorials via invitation acceptance
- **Current**: Invitation creation works, but no acceptance/verification flow
- **Impact**: Family members cannot actually access invited memorials

### 4. Funeral Director Integration
**Issue**: Funeral director role severely underdeveloped
- **Expected**: Full professional workflow with memorial creation and livestream management
- **Current**: Placeholder portal component only
- **Impact**: Core user type cannot perform intended functions

### 5. Schedule Auto-Save Missing
**Issue**: No auto-save functionality for schedule edits
- **Expected**: Auto-save every ≤5 seconds across all roles
- **Current**: Manual save only through modal interface
- **Impact**: Poor UX and potential data loss

## 📊 Implementation Priority Matrix

### 🔥 Critical (Immediate Action Required)
1. **Create `/my-portal` routing system** - Users cannot access portals
2. **Implement invitation acceptance flow** - Family members cannot join memorials
3. **Add photo permission enforcement** - Security vulnerability
4. **Build funeral director portal functionality** - Core user type non-functional

### ⚡ High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Implement follow/unfollow system** - Core viewer functionality
2. **Add schedule auto-save** - UX improvement
3. **Create family member memorial access** - Role functionality gap
4. **Build livestream permission system** - Owner/FD collaboration

### 📋 Medium Priority (Future Sprints)
1. **Enhanced invitation management** - Current system is functional but basic
2. **Admin role preview system** - Development/testing tool
3. **Audit trails and logging** - Compliance and debugging
4. **Remote producer/videographer roles** - Phase 2 features

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Week 1: Critical Infrastructure
1. Create `/my-portal` route with role-based rendering
2. Implement invitation acceptance workflow
3. Add photo upload permission enforcement
4. Build basic funeral director portal functionality

### Week 2: Core Features
1. Implement follow/unfollow system for viewers
2. Add schedule auto-save functionality
3. Create family member memorial access verification
4. Build livestream permission system

### Week 3: Polish & Testing
1. Enhanced invitation management UI
2. Comprehensive role-based testing
3. Security audit of all role permissions
4. Performance optimization

## 📈 Success Metrics

- [ ] All four user roles can access appropriate portals
- [ ] Family members can accept invitations and access memorials
- [ ] Photo uploads respect role-based permissions
- [ ] Funeral directors can create and manage memorials
- [ ] Viewers can follow/unfollow memorials
- [ ] Schedule changes auto-save across all roles
- [ ] Livestream controls work for owners and funeral directors

## 🔍 Technical Debt Notes

1. **Theme Integration**: Many components still use placeholder CSS classes instead of the tribute-theme.css system
2. **Type Safety**: Some API endpoints lack proper TypeScript integration
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across role-based features
4. **Testing Coverage**: No automated tests for role-based functionality
5. **Documentation**: API endpoints need comprehensive documentation
