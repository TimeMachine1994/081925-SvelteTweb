## Streaming Architecture

```
Funeral Director (OBS)
        │
        │ RTMP Stream
        ↓
Cloudflare Stream Live Input
        │
        ├──→ Live Viewers (HLS/DASH)
        ├──→ Automatic Recording (10s timeout)
        └──→ Cloudflare Stream Storage
                    ↓
             Recording Available
                    ↓
          Memorial Page Playback
```

**Status Detection:** 10-second polling checks Cloudflare API for connection state

**Recording:** Automatic after stream ends, 2-5 minute processing time
